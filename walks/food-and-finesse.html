        <h2>Stop 5: Marqt</h2>
        <p>Marqt is a sustainable supermarket. Not all products are necessarily organic, but marqt is selling products coming from local suppliers, produced sustainably without artificial supplements. Because of that, it is not super cheap to go grocery shopping here. But we still advise you to come here as a grocery-shopping-experience. There is a lot to see and do in the store: fresh made pasta or creating your own pizza.</p>

      <div class="panel" id="stop-6" hidden>
        <h2>Stop 6: STACH</h2>
        <p>At STACH you can buy fresh organic bread, nice products to fill your daily shopping, fun gifts and more. Or you can just enjoy a good cup of coffee, while working on your computer. There are a lot of affiliates from STACH in Amsterdam, that are all situated on the corner of the streets. The purpose of STACH is to serve the busy city people. After a busy and stressful work day, STACH offers fresh and healthy ready meals of high quality and at a reasonable price. Partly for that reason, the shop is open 7 days a week and until 10pm (and on Sunday until 9 pm).</p>
